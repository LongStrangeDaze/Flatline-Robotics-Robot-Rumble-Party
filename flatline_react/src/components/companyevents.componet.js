Company and Team Building Events

Flatline Robotics has been igniting excitement at company parties and events for years, helping to inspire teamwork and foster relationships for our business clients.
We give new meaning to the phrase, “creative collisions!”
Bot Bash can instantly create an exciting atmosphere for all types of company parties and events. 
We will organize either a Tournament Bracket for you and your co-workers, Mix and Match, or Fair Style where we hold four-way rumble matches for anyone who wants to jump into the action! 
It's a great way to break the ice between departments or to build rapport and connection between people there is nothing more unifying than the shared goal destroying the other team. 
We also offer “Rumble Sessions,” which can include a DJ service to provide background music for even more exciting battles.
